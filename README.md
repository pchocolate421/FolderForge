# FolderForge

A command-line tool for exporting and recreating directory structures. FolderForge is a simple but powerful utility that allows you to easily document the layout of a folder by exporting its structure to a text file. You can then use that same file to recreate the exact folder and file hierarchy on any machine. This is perfect for documenting project layouts, creating templates, or sharing a consistent structure with your team.

## üìù Features

*   **Export:** Generate a tree-like text representation of any directory.
*   **Create:** Build a complete folder and file structure from a text file.
*   **Filtering:** Use glob patterns to ignore specific directories during export.
*   **Depth Control:** Limit the export to a specific number of directory levels.
